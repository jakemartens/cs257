usage: 'python3 books.py filename [-t [TITLE] [-y] | [-a [AUTHOR]] | [-d DATE DATE]] [-h]'

The books.py function checks the contents of filename, and returns a sorted list of books matching the criteria specified. Only one of -t, -a, or -d may be used at a time. If more than one is used, the program will throw an error.

filename    The database to search. This argument is required. The source should be a CSV file.

-t,--title 	Returns a list of books whose title includes the string inputted by the user, such as "Dark". If TITLE is multiple words, encase it in quotation marks. If no argument specified, returns all books in database.

-y,--year	This is an optional flag that only has an effect on --title. When used, books will be sorted according to publication year. Otherwise, defaults to alphabetical order.

-a,--author	Returns a list of books whose author's names includes the string inputted by the user, e.g. "BrontÃ«". If AUTHOR is multiple words, encase it in quotation marks. If no author specified, returns all books in database.

-d,--date	Returns a list of books whose publication date falls within the range specified by the user in the form "DATE DATE", for example "1948 1996". This flag requires at most two arguments. If only one year is specified, the program returns all books published after that year. Thus, '1996' will return any book published after 1996.
